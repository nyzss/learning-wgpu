# learning-wgpu and rust

i'm trying to learn wgpu, winit and also rust

nothing special about this, i'd recommend [this](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu) resource it's really good

~~currently only rendering a colored background and drawing a rainbow triangle~~
~~currently only rendering a colored background and drawing a pentagone~~
currently rendering some images, this was meant for me to learn more about drawing/rendering shapes/textures, nothing fancy
